# AZTEC NETWORK
This zk-exploration paper has for goal to give a global overview / birds-eye view of the Aztec Network ZK project.

## Introduction
---

### What is Aztec network?

Aztec network is a private Zero-Knowledge rollup on Ethereum. It has been founded in X by X and X. 
They are using the Noir programming language developed in house to prove their computation.


## Technology
---
• Type of stack used for networking and consensus (single sequencer? single prover? open sourced?)
• Programming language to code the VM.
• Type of zk technology used for proving computation (SNARK, STARK, etc.)


Aztec network uses an in house developed programming language called Noir.

## Roadmap
---
• Testnet ready? Open? Beta, Alpha? 
• Date (if any) of production readyness
• Time of inception (first commit)

## Team
--- 
• Team leader prior experience, if any (e.g. Jordi Baylina for Polygon zkEVM coinvented circom2)
• How many people are approx. in the team (e.g. no. of GitHub contributors)


## Examples and Diagrams
---
• Code snippet for a simple opcode commented and explained (e.g. ADD or MUL)
• Final: diagram of the zkEVM flow for a single Tx (from dApp to L1 commitment)

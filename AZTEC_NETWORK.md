This zk-exploration paper aims to depict a global overview view of the Aztec Network ZK project.

## Introduction

### What is Aztec network?

Aztec network is a private Zero-Knowledge rollup on Ethereum based on innovative in house developed PLONK techonology and Noir programming language. It claims itself as "the first and only private ZK-rollup on Ethereum". It has been founded in 2017 by Zac Williamson and Joe Andrews and has for goal to enable and improve Ethereum's privacy, security, efficiency and scalability through cryptography. 

## Technology
• Type of stack used for networking and consensus (single sequencer? single prover? open sourced?)
• Programming language to code the VM.
• Type of zk technology used for proving computation (SNARK, STARK, etc.)


Aztec network uses an in house developed programming language called Noir.

## Roadmap
• Testnet ready? Open? Beta, Alpha? 
• Date (if any) of production readyness
• Time of inception (first commit)

## Team
• Team leader prior experience, if any (e.g. Jordi Baylina for Polygon zkEVM coinvented circom2)
• How many people are approx. in the team (e.g. no. of GitHub contributors)

## Examples and Diagrams
• Code snippet for a simple opcode commented and explained (e.g. ADD or MUL)
• Final: diagram of the zkEVM flow for a single Tx (from dApp to L1 commitment)
